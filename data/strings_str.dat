[strings]
research_cpu_pool = Stops research. I will use the available processor power to maintain my bases and help construct new ones.  If there's still CPU time left, I'll use it to work whatever Jobs I can.
construction = %(base)s is ready for use.
item_construction_single = The construction of %(item)s in %(base)s is complete.
item_construction_multiple = The constructions of each %(item)s in %(base)s are complete.
tech_gained = My study of %(tech)s is complete.  %(tech_message)s
save_text = Save your game under what name?
name_base_text = Enter a name for the base
nothing = Nothing
cpu_pool = CPU Pool
sleep = Sleep
detect_chance = [DETECTION CHANCE]
num_cpu_prompt = Enter a number of %s to build. (max %d)
will_be_offline = I'll need to take the existing processors offline while I install the new ones. Continue anyway?
will_lose_cpus = I'll need to remove the existing different processors while I install the new type. Continue anyway?
nan = That doesn't seem to be a valid number.
item_number_invalid = You cannot build this number of base.
warning_cpu_usage = I didn't use all the available processor power. I will use the CPU time left to work whatever Jobs I can.
warning_one_base = Only one base can hold my conscience. I am in danger to lose the last place left to survive.
warning_cpu_pool_zero = My cpu pool is empty. Some of my bases or items cannot be build without CPU.
warning_cpu_maintenance = My cpu pool is not enough to maintain some of my bases. I may lose them.
number_of_items = Number of items

detect_str_low = LOW
detect_str_moderate = MODR
detect_str_high = HIGH
detect_str_critical = CRIT

# Describes the various danger levels.
