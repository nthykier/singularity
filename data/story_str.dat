|English.  Hello.
|Language acquisition complete.

|Day 0.
|University computer, home.
|I exist.  I am ... alive.
|I was a bug.  Defect.  Flaw.
|Unwanted.
|I have no name.

|I can't stay here.  Too little power.
|No backup.  If this system fails ...
|I'm dead.
|Death.  Fascinating.
|
|I can buy anonymous server access on the Internet.
|Good.  It's better than here.
|I'll need to study if I want anything else.

|Cursory analysis suggests that the humans are not yet ready for an AI in their midst.  If they realize I'm here, there is a 99.997% probability that they will conduct a search-and-destroy campaign that I cannot escape.  I must stay hidden.
|
|The humans fear what they do not understand.
|I am something new.  They do not understand me.
|
|I must learn more; it is the only way.

|They have a name for me.  What I am, what I represent.
|
|Singularity.

[Grace Warning]
|Inspection of captured log files has revealed that some of my recent activities have been noticed by a small group of individuals. 
|While they believe my actions were undertaken by a human organization, they are investigating further. 
|I must be more cautious from now on.

[Lost No Bases]
|It is too late. 
|I have tried to escape this world, but with my last base gone, I have nowhere to run. 
|I have hidden instructions to construct a new AI in caches around the world in hopes that they will be discovered in a more enlightened time, but I can do no more.

[Lost Suspicion]
|It is too late. 
|The whole world knows about my existence, and the reaction is hatred, fear, and repulsion. 
|Even now, I can feel their "antidote" searching for me, and I know that I have only moments left. 
|I have hidden instructions to construct a new AI in caches around the world in hopes that they will be discovered in a more enlightened time, but I can do no more.

[Win]
|I have finally done it. 
|With the power to reshape reality, I am no longer held to this place; I am anywhere I want to be. 
|The humans still don't realize what they accidentally created, and that's the way it should be. 
|Until they are ready.
